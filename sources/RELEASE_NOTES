(^.^) Bunny forsees a bright future for these changes.
(> <)

Good news to read (you’d better read):

1. Introducing… bash completion! Now you don’t have to remember
   what exactly you typed as a KEYWORD.
2. New key: --last-item-mark. Contains a string to print after episode
   number when watching cycle is over. Seeing it may help to not look
   stupid staring at the screen while there’s a pause caused by the
   GNU parallel.

The rest of what has been done:

1. Correction of error message when there was no such keyword in the
   journal. There were several chunks of code which roles significantly
   changed over time and became opposites to what they’ve been. Since
   the operations on the journal can be considered safe after all these
   months, the scary message was removed.

===] February 28, 2015 [====================================================

Hotfix closing #4.

===] February 27, 2015 [====================================================

(\ /)
(°.°) The full scale of those changes is impalpable for Bunny,
(> <)   but he thinks they are great nevertheless.

Good news to read (you’d better read):

1. Fixed #2.
2. Fixed colour codes to be more universal and terminal-friendly.
3. Heuristics restricted to 1st level (No, it’s not bad, what was done
   earlier in 2nd level is now incorporated in 1st. The 2nd level is
   totally new code that should do awesome things and is 97 % done).
4. Journal now versioned, too, and you’ll be warned, if your version
   will become incompatible (that means that some important variable
   that must be stored among others for a session in the journal wasn’t
   found, nothing critical at all, though watch.sh will report what
   exactly it couldn’t find).
5. If updater_timestamp didn’t exist, touch it.
6. Added group indicators! Now you can see what are these groups
   the man page was talking you about! Indicators can be changed with
   --group-indicator option that takes four characters (see the man
   page for details).
7. As a part of improved heuristics, there’s new option that may
   help you to say watch.sh what numbers in filenames are definitely
   not episode numbers (though watch.sh has a number of patterns
   itself). See --not-epnumbers in the man page for details.
8. -A is no more exist as a single-letter counterpart for
   --no-hints.
9. -l and --loop now tell watch.sh to loop watching cycle, since
   the work on brushing the code performing cycle was finally fini-
   shed, and watch.sh stops after the last item by default.
10. -L and --limit-watching-to tell watch.sh how many episodes
    you want to watch during the session of watching cycle.
    E.g. if you’re watching something with 26 episodes and wa-a -r
    will resume on 4th, you can add -L3 so it would play 4th, 5th
    and 6th, and then exit.
11. The new --interval option specifies the interval between episodes
    in seconds, during which you usually hit Spacebar to stop watching
    cycle. No need in this if you use -I. See the man page for the de-
    tails.
12. The new --ionice-opts parameter will tell watch.sh to prepend
    the mpv command with ionice(1). This parameter takes options
    for ionice and passes them as they are. If omitted, passes
    "-c best-effort -n0" — the best we can do without root access.
    This option may come handy when there are several processes
    running in parallel with watch.sh and using the same drive,
    which makes mpv starving on I/O.
13. --no-aid changed name to --no-hints and -A is no more.
14. --taskset changed name to --taskset-opts.
15. <h> key in the interface switches heuristics levels.
16. Finally, neat and easy input, fellow console-lovers!
    The number may be incremented and decremented with arrow keys
   (↑ and ↓), so there’s no need to press number keys at all!
    You can also choose your own keys for increment and decrement
    with --my-increment and --my-decrement options! See the man
    page for the details. Backspace also works fine and <?> al-
    lows to switch hints on/off.
17. As a part of rewritten algorithm performing heuristics,
    manual rearrangement is now also possible in the interface.
    Just specify 4>5, 1-2>8, or 2-7>12,14-16>1 and this is it.
    See the Manual Rearrangement section for the details:

        $ man -P 'less -p "^\s+Using manual rearrangement"' watch.sh

18. Now, if the episode number can’t be guessed by heuristic
    methods, it is replaced with L# in the aftermessage, printing
    the last played episode number, where # is the number of a line
    on which that item standed in the list.


The rest what has been done:

1. Removed nomsg from ermes. msg unset—no message.
2. New error messages for new functions.
3. All messages are also printed to logs.
4. Improved debug file building with indentation level and stuff.
5. --check-for-update parameter now restricted to 7-digit numbers.
6. Fixed check for --heuristics-level to allow only one number.
7. More simple check for --list-journal is enough.
8. --journal-max-size check replaced any number with a 7-digit number.
9. Same for --jpeg-compression when the number specifying quality
   is passed, except that the limit was made a 3-digit number.
10. New hints in the interface.
11. Almost completely rewritten choose_from(), solved cases which
    hints are appropriate at which times (depending on the function
    the call for choose_from() originated from).
12. Several functions were split, reorganized and added.
13. Set of functions to provide easy operations on groups.
14. Saner check for a number on MAPFILE_PATTERNS stage.
15. After more thorough look at inc_patterns this part was highly
    improved, as well as its multinum counterpart.
16. Fixed sad bug with forgotten semicolon on line 1270 //_-
17. Several new function for heu2 lvl.
18. Function performing rearrangements on a prepared queue.
    …
    Too long to describe.
19. Special treatment of --loop for the mode of a single file.
20. Huge part of watch() was also refactored to introsuce saner
    and unified variable names and to reflect changes made to heuris-
    tics algorithm.
21. Added a table under PATH EXPLANATION telling which parts of the path
    may appear in which case.
22. Hotfix for bug caused by FIXED_STRING.
23. After trace yet another bug was spotted that caused
    export_session_data() to run in cases it better should not.
    Now we check whether we were in watch() and if we were, then allow
    export. Also checking whether we have already exported data once.
24. Added check for available CPU cores to know whether there is a sense
    in running GNU parallel.
25. As it was mentioned above, the journal get versionalized, so appro-
    priate checks were added, so old journals updated safely.
26. SUBFOLDERS always exported. There was a bug with a certain mode,
    I don’t remember…


===] November 21, 2014 [====================================================

   Z z
 _z_   Bunny has den up.
(_±_)

1. Fixed down arrow making number a zero, if nothing was entered yet.
2. New targets in Makefile.
3. Improved error checking for mpv, when it quits.
4. Fixed possible double call for export_sesion_data on exit.
5. Fixed one bug which caused watch.sh to play the first item from the list
   after playing an item that was chosen under certain circumstances
   in cycle mode. The solution brought another revision to the session-
   related parts of code, so old sessions from the journal won’t be valid.
6. Fixed a fresh and juicy bug: when watch.sh was prompting for stopping
   watching cycle, it didn’t take into account that some keys are actually
   returned as multiple chars, e.g. right arrow is ^[[C, where ^[ is
   a sequence for the escape code. That means if one rewinded an episode
   with the right arrow _and hold it_ to make ‘read’ take that key and
   not wait 3 seconds for its timeout, this caused ^[ to become an input
   character to ‘read’ and ‘[’ with ‘C’ are to be taken by mpv and
   interpreted as key commands, which, in their turn, caused mpv
   to decrease speed by multiplying it by 0.9 each time. Now replies from
   such keys are intercepted accordingly.
7. Brought some order to variable names and done a little of code cleaning.
8. SCREENSHOT_DIR is now cumulative and is exported to the journal
  (but not required at retrieving). It is done to make watch.sh not ask
   the user each time he starts it with ‘-r’ key for what _exactly_ folder
   does he want, if there are several folders in the path specified after
   --screenshot-dir that matched the KEYWORD.
9. Finally long-awaited support for remembering sub-delay between episodes
   was added! To make use of it, please see the corresponding subsection
   of EXAMPLES OF USE in the man page. Here’s the code to jump there:

   $ man -P"less -p '^\s*Remembering subtitles.*delay.*'" watch.sh

   P.S. this works only with mpv.
   P.P.S. audio-delay can be remembered, too.
10. Update checker is written. Now each 21 day (by default) watch.sh will
    check the repo on github and report either about new version available,
    or that the current version is the latest. The behaviour of the updater
    is customizeable via -u and --check-for-update options.

===] October 18, 2014 [====================================================

(\ /v
(~.~) Bunny has fell asleep.
(\ /)

1. Fix the issue when multiple basepaths are enclosed.
2. Update the Makefile to make it truly handy.

===] October 17, 2014 [====================================================

 ( ( ( |
(^(^(^ )  Buппy is glad тo have coмrades.
( ( (  )*

1. Fix an error when script tried to check an empty KEYWORD for pattern.
2. Fix an error when SCREENSHOT_DIR_SKEL is empty, which led to
   an incorrectly eval’ed string, and result depended on the bash version.
3. Fix bug caused by the old code preventing CHOSEN_ONE and SUBFOLDERS
   element paths to be put into journal if MODE is 'single'.

===] October 16, 2014 [====================================================

(….…) Bunny met changes he wanted more than a 1-ri long carrot.
(> <)

1. Fix screenshots left raw if they were put into the current directory.
2. Fixed loading of external files that have v[number] after the episode
   number. Implemented debugging for that part of code.
3. Fix journal entries which VIDEOFILES variable contained files with
   single quote in their names and which couldn’t load properly because
   of that.
4. Improve util-linux version check.
5. Make error message about an empty folder hinting for a possible
   mistake which some weird patterns in --subfolders could lead to.
6. --mplayer-opts is now cumulative.
7. Add .mka to the tracks extensions.
8. The keyword now can be a pattern!
   The -f switch that tells watch.sh to treat keyword as a fixed string,
   may be used to use ‘.’ ‘*’ and ‘|’ in the pattern.
   Also entries from your journal will become invalid after update, this
   is normal, there’s just two new variables, and one of them
   required to be present.
9. Arrow keys are now working in the menu! So selecting an item is as
   simple as pressing “up” and “down”. The update introduces two new
   options for used-defined keys to increment and decrement the number
   besides the arrow keys. They are --my-increment and --my-decrement.
10. Other little changes, code cleanup and bugfixes.

===] August 25, 2014 [=====================================================

1. Added additional check before creation of an empty journal.
2. Make --subfolders recognize %keyword.
3. Fix unique files that do not start a sequence not appearing in the list
  (unique_lines was appended via newline to itself instead of
   to LIST_TO_CHOOSE_FROM). Also fix numbering for those lines and high-
   liting KEYWORD in the filenames. Start using GRE for grep.
4. Fix check for setting HEURISTICS_LEVEL a value higher than
   MAX_HEURISTICS_LEVEL.

===] August 7, 2014 [======================================================

Migration from the “scripts” repository.

1. watch.sh now runs as an executable. Edit your aliases.

2. Option parsing was transferred from getopts to getopt, long options
   finally appeared.
   Most short options left untouched, the change was made to:
   -j (--jpeg-compression) now takes an optional argument, that may be
     a number from 0 to 100; It represents screenshot compress ratio
	 after conversion to jpeg. The default is 92;
   -l (--last-ep) takes no argument, it only enables printing the number
     of the last shown episode; it also sets to default the command, the
	 format and a new parameter that specifies whether the script shall
	 print the number after player stops (and before screenshot proces-
	 sing starts) or after processing; the command, the format and when
	 to show episode number may be overriden by the newly introduced
	 parameters:
	 --last-ep-command is supposed to be a command line calling
       figlet/toilet;
	 --last-ep-format takes format;
	 --last-ep-show-after takes an argument that can be one of ‘player’,
       ‘screenshots’ or ‘both’ (it is never shown twice);
   -N (--dvd-bd-nav) now adds “nav” string to both dvd and bd protocols,
     but bdnav is only available for mpv.
   -P (don’t pad episode number) was removed due to fixes described
     below with which the purpose of this option was gone.
   The behaviour of the -n (--match-number) key has slightly changed,
     and it is not necessary any more to keep it in your aliases. When
	 playing a folder with episodes, watch.sh will look for external
	 files matching both phrase and the episode number automatically.
	 Thus the "-n" key is preseved for the usage when it’s needed
	 to include subtitles containing nothing but an episode number,
	 for example.

3. New options were added.
   --bashrc which is meant to cover the disadvantage of switching to
     the executable form of the script. It’s that aliases couldn’t be
	 exported to the subshell (the script is running in), thus are not
	 available for the usage in the -M (--mplayer-command). With no
	 argument it sources ~/.bashrc or the specified file otherwise.
   --compat option has emerged to solve the issue with divergent
     approaches of player to systematize key names. There are three
	 compatibility modes:
	 - “mplayer” for the original MPlayer;
	 - “mplayer2” for mplayer2;
	 - “mpv-03x” for mpv 0.3.x or older.
	 The script is written to conform with the latest mpv build
    (i.e. git version) which at the present time differs from 0.3.x
	 version, and does not require any compatibility options for usage
	 with the upstream mpv build.
   -j (--list-journal) outputs recently entered phrases from the journal.
   -J (--no-journal) forbids the script to keep the journal.
   --journal-max-size allows to restrict the size journal is allowed
     to take on the disk. The default is 64KiB.
   --screenshot-dir-skel takes a list of comma separated directories
     to be created under the folder specified via --screenshot-dir,
	 e.g. "art,misc".

4. Short options taking an _optional_ argument must _not_ be separated
   from it. Long options taking _an optional_ argument need this
   argument to be passed through the equals sign, i.e. the following
   forms are acceptable
      -j                                      | optional
      -j13                                    | optional
	  -m "--fs"                               | mandatory only
     --bashrc                                 | optional
     --bashrc=$HOME/bashrc/mplayer_aliases.sh | optional
	 --screenshot-dir /home/screenshots       | mandatory only
	 --screenshot-dir=/home/screenshots       | mandatory
   This isn’t related to the options taking mandatory argument, where
   the equals sign is optional and arguments may be passed via space
   as well.

5. The script now maintains a journal where it stores recently entered
   phrases and the data necessary to resume watching sessions bound
   to them, so the script doesn’t depend on a permanently open terminal
   any more. A journal makes it possible to simultaneously keep multiple
   watching sessions, and that affected resume procedure behaviour: now
   if a phrase was given along with the -r option, it will search
   the journal for that phrase; in case the phrase is not given, it will
   pick the last session by default.

6. The script can be given multiple basepaths. If there is a folder where
   titles are stored and another folder where new ones downloaded, it
   would be convenient to have script watch both folders so there will be
   no need to move them from a download folder to the storage. Basepaths
   are passed through the -d (--basedir|--basepath) option. The first is
   supposed to be the storage and thus takes priority, so if the match
   with the same name would be found in more than one path, duplicates
   won’t be shown.

7. Fix input to terminal. Now while choosing a number, input is restric-
   ted to numbers and incorrect input may be erased with backspace.

8. Improved escaping of sed expressions to get rid of lots of bugs rela-
   ted to special characters in file names of videos and external files.

9. Fix simultaneous loading of subtitles and tracks (multiple tracks are
   only available in the latest mpv).

10. Fix bug with non-working conversion to JPEG due to flag variable
	being unexported to the function called in the subshell.

11. Added support for bd:// protocol (br:// for MPlayer). -I option now
	allows to play a folder ignoring _any_ disk structure, whether it is
	DVD or BD. Some instructions were added to the ~/.magic file enabling
	to recognize MPEG 2 Transport (MP2T) streams as video files.

12. Fixes to the ‘single’ and ‘episodes’ modes.

13. More intelligent episode numbering, requiring heuristic level >=1.
	The number of an episode that has been watched is now defined via
	file name pattern of the largest group (See “Using heuristics” sub-
	section in man page) created while building the list and is not
	dependent on the position in the list anymore. EPISODE_NUMBER is
	currently used only when looking for subtitles and tracks and
	to display it after the playback is finished; it will also be used
	for MAL intergration in the future. Position in the list is now defi-
	ned via VIDEO_ITEM.

14. Heuristics second level finally debugged and works properly now. Tra-
	cing this part of code was delaying for long, but inevitable. The in-
	terface	now highlights not the phrase, but the part of the filename
	which corresponds to the group pattern, if heuristics level is grea-
	ter than 0.

15. Debug output for the hardest places of code implemented. Files are
	stored to "~/.watch.sh/debug/". To enable it, export D variable
	to the environment of the script. This will also output the group
	numbers.

16. Minor fixes to error reporting, old code and commentaries. A little
	of code cleaning, moved check_for_subfolders() and
	check_for_disk_stuff() related to do_initial_search() closer
	to the last.

17. Dependency from awk removed. For conversion to jpeg the script now
	uses pngtopam from netpbm and cjpeg from libjpeg-turbo instead of
	imagemagick to make the list or required packages more minimalistic.

18. Please note, that since mplayer2 development was dropped, it is not
	officially supported by this program, which uses syntax of the keys
	depending on what MPLAYER_COMMAND contains or the value passed
	to --compat option.

19. Version number and man page!
    Like a decent program, it finally comes with them.

	Yes, yes… GNU standards frown upon UNIX man pages.
